Hi, I'm Taylor Ordines. I am a physicist making use of the tools of computation to bring together the best ideas from
- **Quantum field theory** &ndash; ever heard of the QFT-NN correspondance, the notion of describing neural networks in terms of effective quantum field theories?
- **Condensed matter physics** &ndash; imagine understanding the phase landscape of a novel system by *discovering phases with an unsupervised learning program* and *identifying individual phases with a supervised learning program*
- **Machine learning**
- **Quantum information**

The repositories you can find on my profile are a small selection of my portfolio intended to demonstrate a few compelling and pedagogical examples of the intersection between physics, machine learning, and quantum information. Send me an email at orditm15@wfu.edu if you are interested in some other projects I am working on!

Many projects I have implemented in multiple languages, notably **Python**, **R**, and **JavaScript** (you can see all languages used for each project in the summarized cards in the master repository list!). All implementations are housed under the same repository and separated by directory therein. My hope is that anyone interested in the idea behind a project can dive in with minimal difficulty using their most comfortable language &ndash; while this intention was originally developed with physics students in mind, my choice of languages for each project ultimately comes down to appealing to the widest span of curious individuals from academics and researches to industry experts and hobbyists.

At the root of each repository is a **README documentation** file. It contains the "white paper", so-to-speak, detailing the project, its goals and objectives, strategies in implementation, and the results. I have attempted to include as many learning and pedagogical elements into these documents as possible. Refere to these for the necessary background and details of a project.
